Title: US State Population Analysis

This R code retrieves US state population data from a CSV file hosted on a US Census Bureau website. 
It then cleans and processes the data to remove unnecessary rows and columns, extract the state names, and format the numerical data correctly. 
Finally, it saves the processed data as a new CSV file in the working directory. 
The code makes use of various functions and techniques in R, such as read.csv(), gsub(), as.numeric(), colnames(), and select() from the dplyr package. 
This code could be useful for anyone who needs to analyze or visualize US state population data, and provides an example of how to retrieve and clean such data using R.
